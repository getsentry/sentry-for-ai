# Sentry for AI

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a skill _source_ repository — not something you install directly.**
> The skills here are built from this source into installable plugins for

> [Cursor](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-cursor),
> [Codex](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-codex), and
> [Grok](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-grok) — install one of those, not

Your AI coding assistant already knows how to write code. This plugin teaches it Sentry — how to set it up, how to find and fix production issues, and how to get the most out of every feature.

Whether you're adding Sentry to a new project, debugging a spike in errors, or configuring alerts, just ask. The plugin gives your assistant the context it needs to do it right.

Supports [**Claude Code**](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-claude), [**Cursor**](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-cursor), [**Codex**](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-codex), and [**Grok**](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-grok).

## What You Can Do

**Set up Sentry in any project** — SDK setup wizards that detect your stack, recommend the right features, and walk through the full installation. No copy-pasting from docs.

```
Add Sentry to my Next.js app
Set up Sentry in my Rails project
Add error monitoring to my iOS app
```

**Find and fix production issues** — Query your Sentry environment, triage errors, and fix them in place.

```
What are the top errors in the last 24 hours?
Which issues are affecting the most users?
Fix the recent Sentry errors
```

**Review code with Sentry context** — Automatically resolve bugs that Sentry or Seer flag in pull request comments.

```
Review PR #118 and fix the Sentry comments
```

**Configure monitoring** — Set up alerts, instrument AI/LLM calls, connect OpenTelemetry pipelines.

```
Create a Slack alert for new high-priority issues
Monitor my OpenAI calls with Sentry
Set up OTel Collector with Sentry exporter
```

## Distribution

This repository is the single source of truth for all skills, but it is not
itself an installable plugin. Each assistant needs the plugin in a slightly
different shape, so the per-agent plugins are **built** from it by the build
scripts under `plugin-src/<agent>/build.sh`. CI runs these on every push and
deploys each result to its own **distribution repository**, whose root is
exactly that agent's plugin:

| Agent       | Distribution repository                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code | [`getsentry/plugin-claude`](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-claude)  |
| Cursor      | [`getsentry/plugin-cursor`](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-cursor)  |
| Codex       | [`getsentry/plugin-codex`](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-codex)    |
| Grok        | [`getsentry/plugin-grok`](https://github.com/getsentry/plugin-grok)      |

These repositories are generated; do not edit them. Each one's README has the
install instructions for that agent.

The skill library is also browsable at [skills.sentry.dev](https://skills.sentry.dev)
and available through the [`skills.sh`](https://www.skills.sh/getsentry/sentry-for-ai)
installer.

### Build it yourself

Each `plugin-src/<agent>/build.sh` takes an output directory and writes that
agent's plugin into it (the Codex build moves the plugin under `plugins/sentry/`
and swaps the skill tree's `disable-model-invocation` flags for Codex's
`agents/openai.yaml` policy):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-for-ai.git
cd sentry-for-ai
plugin-src/codex/build.sh /tmp/sentry-codex   # or plugin-src/{claude,cursor,grok}
```

To build any target locally, run `plugin-src/<agent>/build.sh <output-dir>`
(`claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, or `grok`).

## Skills

### Core

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `sentry-get-started` | Guided entry point — orients to your current Sentry setup and routes to the right skill |
| `sentry-instrument` | Add Sentry to a project, or wire up any signal — error monitoring, tracing, logging, metrics, profiling, session replay, user feedback, cron check-ins, and AI/LLM monitoring. Detects your platform and pulls the code from the reference library. |
| `sentry-debug-issue` | Find a Sentry issue, pull full context, optionally run Seer root-cause / autofix, apply the fix, and resolve it |

### Workflow

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `sentry-code-review` | Resolve `sentry[bot]` comments on GitHub PRs |
| `sentry-pr-code-review` | Fix issues flagged by Seer Bug Prediction |
| `sentry-sdk-upgrade` | Upgrade the Sentry JavaScript SDK across major versions |

### Feature Setup

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `sentry-setup-ai-monitoring` | Instrument OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, Vercel AI, Google GenAI |
| `sentry-otel-exporter-setup` | Configure OTel Collector with the Sentry exporter for multi-project routing |
| `sentry-create-alert` | Create alerts via the Sentry workflow engine API |
| `sentry-snapshots-cocoa` | Set up Sentry Snapshots for Apple/Cocoa projects |

### Reference Library

`sentry-instrument` doesn't hard-code platform steps — it pulls them from a shared library that the build hydrates into the skill:

- **`references/sdks/<platform>/`** — per-platform install and per-signal code, one directory per supported platform.
- **`references/concepts/`** — per-signal strategy: errors, tracing, logging, metrics, profiling, session replay, user feedback, crons, releases, data scrubbing, and choosing-a-signal.

> Superseded per-SDK "wizard" skills are frozen under `skills-legacy/`, excluded from the plugin build.

## Prerequisites

The plugin configures the [Sentry MCP server](https://mcp.sentry.dev) automatically on install. No extra setup needed.

Some workflow skills require the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
brew install gh    # macOS
gh auth login
```

## Contributing

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io). Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. A skill can declare the shared references it needs in a `references.yml` manifest; the build hydrates the matching files from the shared library at `references/` into the skill so the shipped copy is self-contained.
