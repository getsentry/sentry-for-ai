# Claude Code Plugin Metadata

This directory contains Claude Code-specific plugin configuration.

- `plugin.json` - Plugin manifest (name, description, keywords, logo, MCP servers)
- `marketplace.json` - Marketplace listing for plugin discovery

Shared content (skills, commands) lives at the repo root and is auto-discovered by Claude Code. MCP servers are also defined inline in `plugin.json` for Claude Code.
