# Cursor Plugin Metadata

This directory contains Cursor-specific plugin configuration.

- `plugin.json` - Plugin manifest (name, description, keywords, logo)
- `marketplace.json` - Marketplace listing for plugin discovery

Shared content (skills, commands, MCP config) lives at the repo root and is auto-discovered by Cursor.

For the plugin specification, see the [Cursor Plugin Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins).
